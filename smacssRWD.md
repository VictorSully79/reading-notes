# Responsive Web Design
## Building websites suitable for all user types (varying screen sizes).

## Responsive vs Adaptive
### Rosponsive means to act quickly and positively to any change.  

### Adaptive sites are built to a group of preset factors.

### Responsive is the more popular technique allowing for a wider array of users.  There are three main components.

- flexible layouts
- media queries
- flexible media

### Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fixed measurement units.  This is done by using relative values `target / context = result` 
### This equation will give you the relative width of the target element.  

## Media queries

### You can use media queries inside the existing style sheet or by linking a seperate style sheet.  

### You can used logical operators inside of medie queries to further control the media i.e on vs off.

### Can also be used to control the size of the media window and the orientation.

## Mobile First
### This is the process of using nmedia queries to target smaller viewports as the default style.  

## Flexible Media
### Flexible media allows media to scale in order to keep up with the constant changing of viewport sizes.  

# Floats
## A CSS positioning property 
### Allow for text to wrap around images.
### `float: left;`
### `float: right;`

### Floats can be cleared. A container will collapse if all items in it are floated. 
## Techniques for Clearing Floats
### 
- The Empty Div Method
- The overflow Method
- The Easy Clearing Method
