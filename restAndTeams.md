# 'REST'
Notes on above name article: by Ryan Tomayko

### Roy Fielding helped to write HTTP.  The protocol used to find things on the internet.  The entire WWW is built on a architectural style "REST".
###  Websites use the URL to locate the resouce used to represent the "concept".
### A redirect is when one computer sends another computer to talk to a different computer.
### Polymorphism is the idea that different nouns can have the same verp applied to them. This is important becuase all programming launguages have different nouns and differnt verbs to describe those nouns.  Web frameworks like Ruby on Rails help solve this problem.
