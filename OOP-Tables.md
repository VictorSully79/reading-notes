#Tables
### Tables are used when you need to display items in a grid like and excel spreadsheet. They present information in a grid. This can be useful for organizing information in a way that is more readable. Various elements are used to create a table.

# Objects & Constructors

###  Objects are useful in js as a way to represent items.  Often times there is a need for multiple objects with a similar data set.  Contructores allow you to create a template for adding new sets of data to multiple objects. The `new` keyword allows this to happen.

### After a constructor is made an object can be easily updated using dot notation or square brackets.  


## "THIS"
### `this` is used when you want to refer to an object that a function is created in.  Inside of objects `functions` are referred to as `methods`.

## Arrays
### Arrays hold a related set of key/value pairs.  The key is the values index number.  You can use arrays inside of objects to create a more complex structure.
