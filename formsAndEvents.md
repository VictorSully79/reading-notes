# Forms and Events

## Forms 

### Types of form controls:
- adding text 
- making choices
- submitting forms

### Form Structure is defined using the `<form>` tag. Forms are controlled by the `<input>` tag. The `<textarea>` is used to transmit multiline input. Sometimes you need a user to be able to pick a number of options or a checkbox to pick one or multiple options.  This can all be accomodated in forms.


### All of these forms are used when you want to collect information from a visitor. Information is then sent in name/value pairs.


## Lists, Tables & Forms
### There are special CSS properties created to work with specific types of HTML elements.  

- lists
- tables
- forms

### CSS can allow you to control "Bullet Point Styles" and "Images for Bullets. CSS also allows you to alter table properties. Most often a user needs to "style":

- text inputs and areas
- submit buttons
- labels on forms

### CSS can ensure aspects of tables can look uniform accross all browsers.  

## Events
### There are several different event types and scripts often respond to these events updating the content of the page.


### There are a ton of event types:

- load
- unload
- error
- resize
- scroll

### Events are not limited to these UI events there are others:

- keyboard events
- mouse events
- focus events
- form events

### When you bind an event you state which event you are waiting to happen and the element you are waiting to be effected.

### Events can trigger a JavaScript function. The function can change the page in some way.
