#SQL?
## What is SQL?
### SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is designed for managing data in a database.  SQL introduced new features that the older API's did not have providing access to many records with a single command and eliminating the need the need to specify how to reach the record.  

## Common SQL commands include:
### `SELECT`
### `FROM`
### `WHERE`
### `AND`

### There are multiple versions of tutorials and Cheat-Sheets on the web and a quick Google search will reveal them. Of note is the fact that SQL commands are written in all caps.

### It is helpful to think of commands in SQL in terms of navigating through an exel spread sheet that is represented by your table.  Rows in SQL do not start at index 0, they start at Index 1.
