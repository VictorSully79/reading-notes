## What Is Cybersecurity Automation

Cybersecurity products designed to automate specific processes are widespread, and the likelihood is that you have already implemented automation tools within your organization.

## Why

Organizations are increasingly placing an emphasis on their digital transformation activities and, as a result, are increasing the technical complexity of their enterprise. 

## Benefits

By implementing automation in an organizationâ€™s environment, the cybersecurity team can focus on activities that are more complex. This means that the machine can perform the mundane, repeatable work and cybersecurity team members can devote themselves to more critical, creative and technical work to resolve issues and improve the organizational risk posture.
