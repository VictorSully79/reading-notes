# Operators and Loops


## Operators are?
### Operators evaluate situations comparing values in a way defined by the operator. These include:
`==` Equal To

`!=` Not Equal To 

`===` Strict Equal To

`!==` Strict Not Equal To

`>` Greater Than

`<` Less Than

`>=` Greater Than or Equal To

`<=` Less Than or Equal To

## Logical Operators?
### Operators typically ask a single question with an answer of **True** or **False**.  This can is simple but what if you need to compare more than one item? That is the work of Logical Operators. 


### `&&` `||` and `!` are all Logical Operators allowing you to compare two objects.

`&&` Logical And

`||` Logical Or

`!`  Logical Not

## Loops?
### Loops are just that, a series of instructions that will continue for a predetermined amount of cycles or until a condition is met.

### Loops have 3 parts: Initialization, Conndition and Update. They begin by setting a variable which is usually zero.  Then comes the condition which tells the loop how long to run and/or when to stop.  The update contiues the cycle until the condition is met.
