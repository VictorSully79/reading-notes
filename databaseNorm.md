# Database Normalization
Notes taken from: Database Normalization (Explained in Simple English) via essentialsql.com

## What is it?
### Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
### Databases should be limited in scope in order to reduse the number of duplicated data.

## Three main reasons for Normalization:
- Minimize duplicate data
- Minimize data lost
- Simplify queries

### Three Common forms of normalization:
- 1NF, The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
- 2NF, The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.
3NF,  the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
