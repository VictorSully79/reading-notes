# Creating a Dynamic Web Page with Java.


## What is JavaScript?

### I am very new to programming, barely starting day 4.  Javascript is a script, but what does that mean? The best I can tell so far is it's a recipe that tells the computer what to do in order to make the website more interactive.  


## Writing a Script.


### Since most computers don't learn on their own, instructions need to be very specific and tell the computer what to do everytime it encounters the situation.  With this comes a lot of planning.  Defining what you want the script to do and how you want to implement it is key. It is referred to as the *Behavior Layer* and with my limited skill it behaves like a petulant child :).


### Javascript is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to form a more dynamic experience. Javascript files are incorporated much in the same way CSS files are with a .js extension.  Javascript appears on the page where it is placed in the HTML and defined with the `<script>` element.


## Expressions
### JavaScript uses expressions.  These are broken down to assigning a variable and assigning two or more values to return a single value.


### Expressions use Operators to assign value. These are Operators:

### `+` Adds
`-` Subtracts

`/` Divides

`*` Multiplies

`++` Adds One to the Current Number

`--` Subtracts One From the Current Number

`%` Divides Two Values and Returns the Remainder


## Functions
### Functions allow you to take a group of statments and lump them together to be used in multiple locations.
