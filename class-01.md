# Structure Continued from CF102 

## What is this structure you speak of?

### HTML is the *Bones* of any web page.  When building a new hosue contractors start with the foundation and then call in the **Framers**. Special carpenters that put up the wall and create the general shape of the building.  HTML provides framing.  Where the walls, windows, floor and roof go in is all provided with HTML.  


## Tools of HTML.

### HTML uses a series of tags to frame the web page.The `<header>` signifies what will appear at the top of the page while the oppisite `<footer>` says what is on the bottom.  The `<nav>` for navigation contains the links to other parts of the site, and `<article>` is just that, a stand alone article. 


### Without this structure it would be impossible to implement all of the bells and whistles provided by CSS and Java.  So while HTML might be the old man on the block it is still essential to the building of a proper web page.  


## Points of Realization

1. The body constitutes all visible parts of the page 
1. The head contains things not visible

## Extra Markup
1. HTML 5 is the newest version 
1. '<!DOCTYPE> Declares the HTML type.
1. Comments that you do not want visible should look like this '<!--invisible comment-->'
1. Unique ID's can be assigned to an element in order to identify the id from others in the same element.  
1. Class attributes work much like unique Id's but can pertain to more than one element.
1.  '<div>' element allows the grouping of elements together in a block
1. '<span>' like div pertains to  inline elements 


## HTML 5 Layout

### HTML 5 contains new layout elements that reduce the need for some of the '<div>' and introduced the '<header>' and '<footer>'. Along with several other tags that allow for simpler formatting.


## Process and Design

### There are many question to ask when designing a web page.  Afterall websites are a form of marketing in one way or another.  Very few pages are designed for the use of only the creator. Question include demographic information of the reader and motivation or purpose of the website.  Is the site selling something or dispersing information?  Will there be information gathered by the site? Why do people go to the site?


### Site maps can be created as a layout before you build a site.  Wireframes are helpful in helping to layout the information on a page.  

## The ABC of Programming


## What is JavaScript?

### I am very new to programming, barely starting day 4.  Javascript is a script, but what does that mean? The best I can tell so far is it's a recipe that tells the computer what to do in order to make the website more interactive.  


## Writing a Script.


### Since most computers don't learn on their own, instructions need to be very specific and tell the computer what to do everytime it encounters the situation.  With this comes a lot of planning.  Defining what you want the script to do and how you want to implement it is key. It is referred to as the *Behavior Layer* and with my limited skill it behaves like a petulant child :).


### Javascript is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to form a more dynamic experience. Javascript files are incorporated much in the same way CSS files are with a .js extension.  Javascript appears on the page where it is placed in the HTML and defined with the `<script>` element.


## Expressions
### JavaScript uses expressions.  These are broken down to assigning a variable and assigning two or more values to return a single value.


### Expressions use Operators to assign value. These are Operators:

### 
`+` Adds

`-` Subtracts

`/` Divides

`*` Multiplies

`++` Adds One to the Current Number

`--` Subtracts One From the Current Number

`%` Divides Two Values and Returns the Remainder


## Functions
### Functions allow you to take a group of statments and lump them together to be used in multiple locations.
