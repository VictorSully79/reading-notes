# Text Editors
## Why use a Text Editor?


Text editors are the platform that code is entered on.  If you want to code you need a text editor. There are many different types and most computers come with one built right in.
So why would you download one.  After reading about them I have come to the conclusion that text editors are like vehicles.  They can get you from point A to B, but it's about the 
options.  If you travel alot, or like Seattle sit in traffic a lot, options make a difference.  Sitting in traffic sucks, but AC, Music and all the bells and whistles make it soo 
much better.  


### Commonly used features include:
