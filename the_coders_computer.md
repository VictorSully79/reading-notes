# Text Editors
## Why use a Text Editor?


Text editors are the platform that code is entered on.  If you want to code you need a text editor. There are many different types and most computers come with one built right in.
So why would you download one.  After reading about them I have come to the conclusion that text editors are like vehicles.  They can get you from point A to B, but it's about the 
options.  If you travel alot, or like Seattle sit in traffic a lot, options make a difference.  Sitting in traffic sucks, but AC, Music and all the bells and whistles make it soo 
much better.  In the end, it is all about coding on a platform that you are comfortable with.  


### Commonly used features include:
- Code Completion
- Syntax Highlighting
- Themes
- Availability of Extentions

## Text Editors vs IDEs
IDE or Integrated Development Enviroment is a compilation of coding software, like useing Gmail. My Gmail account will not only show me my email, but clicking on a plethra of buttons it gives me options like calendar, contacts, maps, search, translate and even news. Unrelated but creepy, when we travel it will send me a travel map when I get home showing all the places I went with the photo's I took from my phone as proof. IDE's have a lot of functions that I don't yet uderstand in my young journey to become the CEO of Microsoft.  Here are some of the common features:

- Text Editor
- Debugger
- Compiler
- Code Completion
- Programming language support
- Integrations and plugins
