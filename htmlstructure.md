# Structuring With HTML 

## What is this structure you speak of?

### HTML is the *Bones* of any web page.  When building a new hosue contractors start with the foundation and then call in the **Framers**. Special carpenters that put up the wall and create the general shape of the building.  HTML provides framing.  Where the walls, windows, floor and roof go in is all provided with HTML.  


## Tools of HTML.

### HTML uses a series of tags to frame the web page.The `<header>` signifies what will appear at the top of the page while the oppisite `<footer>` says what is on the bottom.  The `<nav>` for navigation contains the links to other parts of the site, and `<article>` is just that, a stand alone article. 


### Without this structure it would be impossible to implement all of the bells and whistles provided by CSS and Java.  So while HTML might be the old man on the block it is still essential to the building of a proper web page.
