# Pair Programming
#### From: 6 Reasons for Pair Programming by: Allie Grampa

### Pair programming allows for two people to work on a single coding task together.  It has been proven to increase the overall quality of the work.  It reminds me of writing a paper and reading over my own typos because I knew what I “wanted to write”.

## Two People
- Driver - Does the physical Keyboarding
- Navigator - Focuses on the overall coding picture, looks for bugs, typos and can use his computer to look up tools and solutions

### Just like learning a foreign language people do better when they hear, speak, read and write the new language.  Programming is no different.  

1. Greater efficiency
	- Less bugs in the code.
	- Two people can find solutions faster when stuck.
	- Better team communication
	- More Enjoyable
2. Engaged Collaboration
	- More engaged in the work with less distractions and procrastination.
3. Learning from Others
	- Exposes the programmer to new approaches to problem solving and solutions
	- Greater understanding of a skill you can/have to explain.
4. Job Interview Readiness
   - Job interviews may require a pair programming exercise pairing the applicant with a current   employee.

# jQuery

#### jQuery – Notes from JavaScript and jQuery book by: Jon Duckett

### -	Simpler access to elements
-	Easier to perform tasks
-	Methods for event handling

jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in the web page. It uses CSS-style selectors most developers are familiar with. These selectors allow for the use of jQuery methods. 
## Elements:
-	Find elements
-	Do something with elements	`$()` is short for `jQuery()`
### jQuery is popular because it allows you to do much more with much less code.  Everything in jQuery could be done with JavaScript but many studies have shown jQuery provides a simpler faster approach.  The Motto is “Write less, do more”
### jQuery also handles cross browser compatibility issues by using feature detection to find the best way to achieve a task.  
### CSS style selectors can be found on PAGE 302-303
jQuery allows you to:
-	Get element content
-	Update elements
-	Change Content
-	Insert Elements
-	Add new content
-	Set Attribute Values
-	Work with Attributes
-	Set CSS properties
-	Handle events more efficiently
`.each` allows you to loop through all the items in a selection.
`.on` handles all the events behind the scenes.
