# Using CSS to Design Your Page
## CSS?

### While HTML is the *Bones* of your structure CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the fashionable interior designer.



### CSS allows the user to control HTML elemets as if they were in their own box. Basically, if my wife tells me to paint the living room walls I don't go through and paint over everything hanging on them.  Furniture must be moved and pictures taken down so only the defined space of *the wall* gets painted.



## How does CSS do this?

### CSS uses two things a **Selector** and a **Declaration**. Selector indicates what the rule applies to and declaration says what to do. Example:

```css
p {font-family: VictorsAwesomeFont;}
```
### This would indicate everything in the "p" element should be displayed in VictorsAwesomeFont.  


### It doesn't just work with fonts.  It can control every element of your HTML in one form or another.
