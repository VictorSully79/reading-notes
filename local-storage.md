# Local Storage and The Web
### In the beginning there was Microsoft. Internet Explorer was the only browser most people knew and as such made a lot of the rules.  The local data stored allowed in a "cookie" was 64kb.

### Along comes everyone's Super Hero "Flash" and allowed users to store even more data. Just a mear 5 years later the villian "Google" introduced Gears that allowed for unlimited amounts of data stored locally.

### HTML 5 set out to create a standardized API implemented natively and consistantly.  

### The data is stored locally and never transmitted to the server and can be of any data type.

### The amount of data is a huge 5 megabytes.
