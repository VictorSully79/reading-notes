# Images
### Images are important to the presentation and even relevance of modern web pages.  This means that learning to handle them withinn HTML and CSS are vitaly important.  There are many things to consider when adding images to the page:

- Where will the image go
- What type of image will be used
- What is the size of the image
- How will the image effect the loading of the page

### Images are added with the an '<image>' tag. '<src>' will tell the browser what the source of the image is. Various tags such as '<alt>' '<title>' '<height>' and '<width>' all let the browswer know how to handle the image.

### Where you place the '<image>' tag inn your code effects how and where it will be displayed on the page.


# Color
### Color is an integral part of a web page.  It sets the tone and can grab the attention of the visitor even before the reading begins.  CSS offers a ton of ways to display color, RGB values, Hex codes and even just color names.  CSS also allows Hue, Saturation and Brightness to be controlled.  

### Contrast is important to the readability of the web page.  Ensuring that your text color is easily readable on the background.  Opacity is how transparent an object is.  Wood or glass is how I remember it.  There are many color pickers available and a quick Google search will reveal plenty.  


# Text
### The properties that control text are broken down in to two catagories
- Directly affects the font
- Directly that have the same effect on text no matter the font

### Oblique takes the font exactly as it appears and adds a slant to it, while Italic slants the text and ads cursive tails to it.

### Not all browsers recognize all fonts so it is important to have a backup font.  
### Just like using a word processor CSS allows you to alter the size and look of the font on the page.  Allignment and spacing can all be set or changed.
