These are my reading notes from Codefellows. [^1]

### About Me
My name is Victor and I have always had a love for computers. I spent 9 years in the Army and 5 years as a Deputy Sheriff.  I finally took the leap to learn. 
My wife is a registered nurse and way smarter than I am.  We have 2 dogs and a cat which are way too spoiled :smile:
My Github is https://github.com/VictorSully79

### Growth Mindset
How to stay in a growth mindset. Here are my 3 examples.
1. Remember everyone was a beginner at some point. I have studied many subjects in the past.  I never started out experienced.  It is important to remember with any new task there is a learning curve.
2. Recognize when your mindset shifts from "Growth" to "Fixed" and take steps to get it back. Google is your friend.  Seek out the answer and if frustration sets in, take a break.
3. Perseverance is key, *when at first you don't succeed, **try** and try again.* No one ever completed anything they quit.
