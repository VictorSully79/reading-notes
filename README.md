### Growth Mindset
How to stay in a growth mindset. Here are my 3 examples.
1. Remember everyone was a beginner at some point.
2. Recognize when your mindset shifts from "Growth" to "Fixed" and take steps to get it back.
3. Perseverance is key, *when at first you don't succeed, **try** and try again.*
