# Lists and Boxes
## Lists


### HTML offers a series of differant types of lists.  They are broken down into 3 catagories.
- Ordered lists 
- Unordered Lists
- Definition Lists
- Nested Lists

### Many of this lists have better options when you use css to style them. You can also place lists inside of lists.  Think of recipes that contain an additional list of ingredients.

## Boxes
Everything you see on a webpage can be broken down into a series of boxes.  I best understand this when thinking of packing a uhaul.  Items are first padded for protection then stuck in an appropriate sized box. Then that box is placed next to another box.  These items can be placed as close or far apart as needed by using padding.

Boxes can be assigned attributes width, height, Border, padding, and margin. Boxes can contain additional boxes and those boxes can be told how to relate to the other boxes spatially. 

CSS can be used to change the structures of a box to fit a page.  Boxes don't have to be squares.

# Arrays
## What are Arrays?
### Arrays are a variable that let you contain multiple items.  The best part is these can all be different values.


### Values in an array act like the items in an ordered list and can be recalled by useing the index number automatically assigned to them.  Remembering the values start at 0 is probably the most confusing thing.  I view zero as the start line and it helps.  

# IF ...Else Statements

## Brain Hives.......

### If else statements look simple enought but wrapping my brain around them is a little tough.  Basically they check a statement to see if it is true.  They check the first statement if it is true the code is ran, if it is not the ELSE is then checked and the code is ran.


### Switch statements use a variable 'switch value' . These are used to run code if a specific value is met.

## I will be added more to this in the next couple of days.  Really need to wrap my head around this.
