## Variables
### - **Instance Variables** (Non-Static Fields) "non-static fields" => instance variables.
### - **Class Variables** (Static Fields) any field declared with the *static field*.  This tells the browser there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated.  
### - **Local Variables** a method will often store it's temporary state in *local variables* There is no special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination comes entirely from the location in which the variable is declared â€” which is between the opening and closing braces of a method. As such, local variables are only visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class.
### - **Parameters** are always classified as *variables* not *fields* 
## Naming
### Name things so they are easy to identify.
## Primitive Data Types
### Java is statically typed so all variables must be declared before used.

- int
- long
- float
