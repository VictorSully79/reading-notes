# Objects:

## Objects are groups of variables and functionns to create a model of something you would recognize in the real world.  Inside of an object variables become objects and fucions become methods. 

- Literal notation

## Literal Notations may look like
''' var hotel ={
  name: seaCrest
  rooms: 50
}'''

## Accessing the object uses Dot Notation 
''' var hotelName = hotel.name;

# Document Object Model
## "DOM's" tell browsers how to create a model of an HTML
## DOM trees have nodes
- Document
- Element
- Attribute
- Text
## These can all be further broken down to specifically select individual properties.
## Element nodes allow you to access the contents of the element.
## Just like the HTML you can access the children and siblings. You can view the DOM tree from most browsers.
