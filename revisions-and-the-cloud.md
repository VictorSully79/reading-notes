# **How to Get your Git On**
## What is Git?
### Git is a DVCS or *Distributed Version Control System*.  Back in The Stone Age coders used to rely on a single server to store countless hours of code.  Which reminds me, my grandma used to say *Don't put all your eggs in one basket*, seems like the same thing.  If a server crashed or a hard drive failed, all was lost.

### With git all of the files are stored and mirrored in snapshots with a redundant backup. This makes the likelyhood of losing the work minimal.  It tracks changes and has a super-duper complicated method for allowing multiple people to add on to a file, called a repository, at the same time.
