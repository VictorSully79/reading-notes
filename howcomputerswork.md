# How Computers Work
## In the Beginning
### Computers were huge! Taking up entire rooms to do nothing but math.  As time went on technology made computers smaller and smaller.  Now they are basically in everything we use.  


### As computers got smaller they also became faster.  The distance between the circuits dramatically decreased thus increasing the speed. 

### Computers all do the same thing.  They take input, store information, process the informationn stored and output the information.
